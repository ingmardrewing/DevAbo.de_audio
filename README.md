# DevAbo.de_audio
A location based audio play belonging to the DevAbo.de story

This iOS 9 Application is an attempt to create a location based audio play:
While the User walks with his headphones around certain locations corresponding audio tracks
start playing. Every track plays only once (at least for now). 

The list for the connection between the audio files and the locations resides in the Tracklist.m file.

For debugging purposes the app lists the latitude and longitude updates and the played audio files on the screen.
